# BasicBrute
A basic "brute force" library generator

This is a test file (or assortment of) for a password libray generator. The reasoning behind it is for applications like aircrack (since it uses just a file). 

It is made to be as small and simple as possible. Programs that do things like this tend to use Gigabytes of memory. An example is for 8 charcter passwords, projected to use 20,000+ Gigabytes of RAM. This file (or assortment) have an explicit use of garbage collection, lowing the memory (from my testing) to only 10 MB. As I have stated, it is basic, so there is no multicore support at the time of this README 5/7/18. It, for that reason, has no real value. 

This is my test at a password string generator.

No license, do what you want with it.
